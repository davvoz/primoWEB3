# README - Example Web 3

This README provides an overview of the HTML document named "Example Web 3".

## Overview

The "Example Web 3" HTML document demonstrates how to create a web interface for interacting with Ethereum using MetaMask. It allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, retrieve their account information, display their balance in Wei, Ether, and Euro, and interact with Ethereum through a simple UI.

## Features

- Connect to MetaMask wallet.
- Retrieve account information.
- Display balance in Wei, Ether, and Euro.
- Handle errors gracefully.

## Usage

To use this HTML document:

1. Ensure you have MetaMask installed in your browser.
2. Open the HTML document in a browser that supports MetaMask.

## Dependencies

- [Animate.css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css): A library for adding CSS animations.
- [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/): A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## How It Works

1. When the "Connect to MetaMask" button is clicked, the script attempts to connect to the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask.
2. If MetaMask is detected, it retrieves the user's account information and balance.
3. It then fetches the current Ethereum price in Euro from the CoinGecko API.
4. Finally, it updates the UI to display the user's information and balance in different currencies.
